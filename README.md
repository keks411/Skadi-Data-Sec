# Skadi-Data-Sec

current issues:

Offline:
- Delete report-directory after offline-scan
- Progressbar not working (value=0) offline-scan

General:
- Unfreeze (use async task)
- Add loop to add basic info like "is still running" while scanning (maybe simple textbox?)
- Inetcheck online not visible when online
- Package with .net installer 5.0 x64
- Maybe create stand-alone for annoying customers? (downside: is big af)
